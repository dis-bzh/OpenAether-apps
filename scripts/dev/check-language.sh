# Find French prose where the repository says English is canonical.
#
# CLAUDE.md asks for a detector and there was none, in either repository, which
# is why the 2026-07-28 switch left ~50 lines behind and a later audit still
# found seven whole files.
#
# A COPY of OpenAether-infra/scripts/dev/check-language.sh, deliberately. The
# alternative was one repository's CI cloning the other, and that was tried
# first: it clones a branch, so it audits whatever `main` happens to hold rather
# than what the pull request changed — red for a reason the author cannot fix.
# Each repository checks itself. Keep the two in step by hand; they are ~110
# lines and change rarely.
#
# Two things this gets right that the obvious version does not:
#
#   1. It does NOT key on accents. `preflight-quotas.py` says "DEPASSEMENT" and
#      two `ovh/*.tf` comments are accent-free French; an accent regex reports
#      them clean, which reads as "nothing there". Words, not diacritics.
#   2. It only reads prose — Markdown outside code fences, and comment lines in
#      code. A French word inside a string literal or an identifier is not a
#      translation defect, and flagging it would train people to ignore this.
#
# Usage: check-language.sh [path ...]        (defaults to the repository root)
#        check-language.sh --list            list the words it looks for

# Words chosen for one property: they are French and they are not English, not
# an identifier, and not a common abbreviation. That rules out the tempting ones
# — `son`, `car`, `pas`, `on`, `or`, `sur`, `main` — every one of which is an
# ordinary English word or appears in code.
